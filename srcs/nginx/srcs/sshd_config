# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# The default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2
# but this is overridden so installations will only check .ssh/authorized_keys
AuthorizedKeysFile	.ssh/authorized_keys

#AllowAgentForwarding yes
# Feel free to re-enable these if your use case requires them.
AllowTcpForwarding no
GatewayPorts no
X11Forwarding no


# override default of no subsystems
Subsystem	sftp	/usr/lib/ssh/sftp-server

Port 22
PermitRootLogin yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
